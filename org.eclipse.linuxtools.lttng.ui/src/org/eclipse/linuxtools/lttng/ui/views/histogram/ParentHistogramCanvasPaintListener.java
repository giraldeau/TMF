/**
 * <b><u>HistogramCanvasPaintListener</u></b>
 * <p>
 * Implementation of a PaintListener for the specific need of the ParentHistogramCanvas.
 * <p> 
 * The difference with the default one is that this one take a content that is the power of 2 higher 
 * 		than the display size.<p>
 * 
 * When it is time to draw, it takes the closest power of 2 smaller than the canvas size; it is then easy to 
 * 	  	concatenate the interval as they are both power of 2.<p>
 * The difference between the power of 2 and the not-power-of-2 canvas size is then filled by drawing bar that are
 * 		slightly larger every (power/canvasSize) interval.<p>
