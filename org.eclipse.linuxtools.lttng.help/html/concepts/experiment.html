<h1>Experiment</h1>
<p>
An experiment consists in an arbitrary number of aggregated
<a href="trace.html">LTTng traces</a>. In the degenerate case, an experiment
can consist of a single trace.
<p>
The experiment provides a unified, time-ordered stream of the individual LTTng
trace events.
<p>
Since the individual traces are likely to have unsynchronized clocks (or at
least skewed with respect to each other), the experiment supports a timestamp
adjustment scheme that synchronizes all the events against a common reference
clock. This simplifies events correlation between traces.
