<H1>Limitations</H1>
<P>The current implementation is still under heavy development and
some important features are still missing.<BR>Here is a list of the
known bugs and missing features that are worked on.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Thread issues affect
	performance</B></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">The multi-thread
	access to the traces is mostly turned off for now so the user might
	experiment a very long load time when opening a trace and/or
	zooming. Of course, this is especially true for big trace.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">In
	the future, the traces with be opened and indexed asynchronously,
	with the result of greatly improved performance.</SPAN></P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>No support for individual traces</B></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The code for loading and parsing an individual
	trace (not part of an experiment) is currently disabled. As a workaround,
	just create an experiment with the single trace you want to analyze.
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>One trace per experiment is
	currently supported</B></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Work to be able to merge and index
	several traces into a single experiment have not being completed
	yet. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the future, it will be possible to
	process several traces at once and to compare them in the views.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
    <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Time Frame View</B></P>
    <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In some cases, the End Time of the Time
    Frame view is not set correctly (symptom: the nanoseconds are identical
    to the Start Time nanoseconds and the Interval nanoseconds = 0).
    <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
    To set it properly, just spin up the End Time seconds field.
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Simultaneous data requests</B></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All views are currently working on a
	standalone basis. Therefore, time selection synchronization among
	views does not trigger simultaneous data requests, which heavily
	hurts the performance of the application. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the future, data request will be
	centralized in the application, resulting in better response time in
	and between views.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>No trace recording capability
	in Eclipse yet</B></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is not currently possible to record
	a new trace directly in Eclipse, an user that would like to record a
	new trace would need to use external tools, like LTTv.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the future, a &ldquo;Control view&rdquo;
	will be provided for the user to allow him to easily a new trace
	inside Eclipse. It should also be possible to start the recording on
	a remote host from that view.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Experimental Multi-CPU support</B></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Although working, some more work need
	to be done on trace that handle multiple processors. It is reputed
	to work already but this feature is mostly untested for now.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the future, multi-CPU should be
	supported and work as well as uni-CPU traces.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Experimental 64 bits and/or non
	x86 architecture implementation</B></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The code used to read and parse files
	have not been extensively tested on 64 bits and was not tested at
	all on architecture different than x86 computer. The code is
	believed to work on a broad horizon of architecture but this cannot
	be certified for now.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the future, all x86 (32 and 64
	bits) as well as all PPC (32 and 64 bits) should work and possibly
	some (all?) models of SPARC. 
	</P>

<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Missing filters and ordering on
	all views</B></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is currently no way to filter
	events following some criteria or to dynamically sort the different
	fields. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the future, both should be
	implemented.

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Some views missing and/or need
	more work</B></P>
	<P>Some more views (&ldquo;Control&rdquo;, &ldquo;Histogram&rdquo;,
	etc...) are currently missing but planned in the Eclipse
	implementation and some others (&ldquo;Statistics&rdquo;) are
	working but need more work to be brought were they need to be.<BR>In
	the future, all views provided by LTTv will be supported in Eclipse
	and more!</P>
