/**
 * 
 * Here in TMF, the Strings will contain the "path" in the state system's /proc-like tree, for example:
 * "System/Processes/PID150/exec_mode"
 * "System/CPUs/CPU0/current_process"
 * 
 * ... and the char[] will contain the "values" that goes in this path, for example:
 * "running"
 * "2014" (representing a PID)
 * 
 * Note that this char[] will stay the same throughout the whole StateHistory environnment, and
 * will be contained in the field 'char[] value' of the SHT-Intervals
 * 
 * The Strings, however, will be converted to numbers, kind of like a dynamic Quark table.
 * To do so, they will be stored in a Hashtable, which will associate them with an index number (int)
 * This number is the 'key' that will be used in the State History Tree.
 * 
 * 
 * Finally, there is also the BuilderTree, which adds a Timevalue to every element in currentStateInfo.
 * This variant is used when building the State History Tree, as we retain the "start time" of the element. When
 * it gets replaced, we can build an interval from the old start time and the start time of the new info, which is = to the
 * end time of the one that got replaced (did that make sense?)
